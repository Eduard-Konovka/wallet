## About our project

Live single page application connected to Mongo DB database by custom
[web server](https://github.com/vladibon/wallet-api). Back end docs are available under the
[following link](https://wallet-proj.osc-fr1.scalingo.io/api-docs/#/).

To use our app first thing you need is to create an account. If you don't have time and want to
quickly check how application works, you can use our Demo version (you'll find the link on the
Registration page). The only restrictions you will have with the demo version is that you won't be
able to change neither user name, nor email or avatar. So, after getting to know our app, don't
hesitate to create your own account and get all the experience!

After successfull registration you can easily log in and out using your credentials. Your session is
totally secure thanks to the unique session token created for you on server, which is valid for the
next 24 hours. If you haven't logged out - session can be restored and you don't need to sign in
again within this time.

In the app you can add various transactions to your personal history and track it in the future.
Also you can get statistical data about your registered transactions - easy way to control past
expenses and plan future ones. Beautiful colorful diagram will help you visualize your finances
movement.

One more useful feature is that you can add your own categories to sort your transactions. You will
find this option while adding new transactions - the select input can accept your custom categories
(except for the demo mode, as we mentioned previously).

There also is great feature in our app - up to date currency exchange. You can check hryvna course
to the dollar and to the euro, and also bitcoin course to the dollar.

Finally you can customize your experience in the Account section. You can open it by clicking on
your avatar or name in the upper right cornere inside header. Here you can change your user name,
your email (if you need) and update your avatar. You can upload any picture as long as it is under
1Mb and has PNG or JPEG mimetype.

Sometimes internet connection can be unstable or even the server can freeze for a moment. Our app
will not crush, we are handling possible errors, even with internet connection. If anything, you
will be redirected to the "Server error" page, from where you can try to reload the page. We want
you to have the best experience from using Wallet app!
